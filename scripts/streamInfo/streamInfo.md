### StreamInfo manual

`streamInfo.py` allows you to have several public information of a stream (either yours or someone else's).

**Externals Python libraries needed :**
- requests (2.27.1, last version supported by Python 3.6)
`pip install requests==2.27.1`
https://github.com/psf/requests/releases/tag/v2.27.1

**Settings to fill :**
- Your channel's name, ex: lotharie
- Client ID
- Oauth token
- Title Source, which source you want for the title of the stream channel
- Category Source, which source you want for the category of the stream channel
- Update Interval (optionnal, by default 20s)

If you have problem running this Python script, please make sure you carefully follow the instructions from the <a href="https://github.com/LotharieSlayer/OBS-scripts">README</a> file at the root of this repository.

### Why is it useful for me ?
To make a "Up Next" scene that I can integrate into my Pause scene.
