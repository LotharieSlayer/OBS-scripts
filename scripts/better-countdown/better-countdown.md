### Better Countdown manual

`better-countdown.lua` is just a rework from countdown.lua where hours are deleted because it is not very useful.

**Settings to fill :**
- Duration in minutes
- Text Source where minutes wiil be countdown
- Final Text (optional, by default empty)

If you have problem running this python script, please make sure you carefully follow the instructions from the <a href="https://github.com/LotharieSlayer/OBS-scripts">README</a> file at the root of this repository.

### Why is it useful for me ?
To make a great countdown with beautiful text source on my Pause scene. And because making a pause about an hour for a streamer is just unbelievable.
